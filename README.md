## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze customer data to understand patterns in purchasing behavior and predict future purchases. The project follows a structured approach involving data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and correlation analysis to extract meaningful insights.

## Dataset

The data is assumed to be in a file named `customer_purchase_data.csv`, which contains information on customers, their demographics, and their purchase details. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, transforming columns, and removing uninformative features.

## Installation

To set up the project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
